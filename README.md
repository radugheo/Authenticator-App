# Authenticator-App

This is a simple app that I made to get accustomed to using Firebase register and login. It contains 4 activities (screens): Main, Intro, Login, Register. 

The Java code for each activity is found [here](https://github.com/radugheo/Authenticator-App/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/autentificare).

Its main purpose is to create an account that is stored in Firebase using the Register activity and to login into that account with the Login Activity. After logging in, the user is redirected to a page where their username is displayed.
